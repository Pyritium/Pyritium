# Hey there! 

I'm Joshua! A very ambitious computer engineer.

I have a particular captivation to low level programming, including graphics, and my hobbies mainly consist of working on, thinking about interacting with, making my own, or taking apart: games (within game engines), game engines, geometric kernels/drivers, & rendering engines!
