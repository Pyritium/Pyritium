# 🌱 Aspiring Software Engineer

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile! Please take a moment to read my README to find out a little bit about myself.

## 🔰 Experiences

- **Self-Taught**: My journey in software engineering has been largely self-guided. I have taken the initiative to explore various programming languages, technologies, and concepts on my own, which has allowed me to develop a well-rounded skill set.

## 📚 Languages

### 🧰 C++ (2+ years of experience)

- **1 year of experience**: I spent a year learning the subtleties underlying C++, polishing my skills through real projects and coding difficulties, mainly all self projects.

- **Intermediate**: My grasp of C++ allows me to write efficient and optimized code. I'm comfortable with various features of the language and am always eager to dive deeper, and to learn more.

### 🌑 Lua

- **5 years of experience**: Lua has something I've sunk a lot of time into. I've used it a lot in a variety of tasks, from game development to scripting.

- **Advanced / Expert**: With years of hands-on experience, I've become adept at harnessing the power of Lua to create dynamic and flexible solutions. From game mods to complex automation scripts, I'm well-versed in the language.

## ❓ About Me

I have a sincere passion for software engineering and a strong ambition to push the envelope of what is feasible. I am not afraid to admit I am just starting out, and barely grasping the surface of what software engineering is, but I have ever since started enjoyed it thoroughly! I get a lot of joy out of using code to solve challenging issues and realize concepts. 

My special passion for 3D software, math, and physics keeps me heavily interested, determined & inspired to keep learning and growing.

Feel free to explore my (although scarce) repositories to see the projects and solutions I've worked on. Please contact me if you are interested in anything that I'm up to, or want to just talk about software engineering.
