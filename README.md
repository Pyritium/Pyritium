Hey there, I'm Joshua! A very ambitious computer engineer *(albeit pretty inexperienced...)*! 

I've loved programming ever since I was a teenager, and I have a particular captivation to the rendering aspect of programming, which are not limited to: game engines, geometric kernels/drivers, rasterization engines, really any of it! I also LOVE low level programming!

If you want to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
