# Hey there! 

I'm Joshua! A very ambitious computer engineer *(albeit pretty inexperienced...)*! 

I have a particular captivation to the rendering aspect of programming, which are mainly, but not limited to: game engines, geometric kernels/drivers, & rasterization engines! I also am a big fan of lower level programming.

If you want to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
